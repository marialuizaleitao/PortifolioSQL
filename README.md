# SQL Samples!

Welcome to my GitHub repository for MySQL database basic projects and exercises! This repository is designed to showcase my skills and knowledge in MySQL as a beginner data science student.

In this repository, you will find various projects and exercises that I have completed to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental concepts in MySQL, such as creating databases, tables, and performing CRUD operations. Each project and exercise includes a detailed README file explaining the problem statement, methodology, and outcome.

This repository is intended to be a valuable resource for future employers and recruiters to assess my proficiency in MySQL and to gain insight into my problem-solving abilities. It is also a great place for other beginner data science students to learn from and get inspired by my projects and exercises.

Feel free to browse through the repository and check out my projects and exercises. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

Thank you for visiting! üëãüèª
